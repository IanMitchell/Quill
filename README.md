# Quill

Quill wants to be a blogging platform. At the moment, it's really just something I'm making to learn Rails. As such, there are a lot of errors and half-implemented features. I'm sure there are plenty of best-practices that I've broken as well. If you notice anything specific, please let me know! I'd love to change it.

It should be noted that Quill is still very much in development, and shouldn't be used as a live website. Hopefully we'll be able to offer a stable release soon!
