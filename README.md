# Quill

Quill wants to be a blogging platform. At the moment, it's really just something I'm making to learn Rails. As such, there are a lot of errors and half-implemented features. I'm sure there are plenty of best-practices that I've broken as well. If you notice anything specific, please let me know! I'd love to change it.

It should be noted that Quill is still very much in development, and shouldn't be used as a live website. Hopefully we'll be able to offer a stable release soon!

#### Current Development

Since I'm now at school, development has hit a bit of a standstill. This is still very much a project that I want to pursue however, and I'll be returning to it when I have time. I'll still be pushing updates occasionally!

#### Conclusion

If you'd like to see Quill in action, a current version is running the development blog:
