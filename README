= Quill

Quill is a blogging platform. Just something I'm cooking to learn Rails really. If you see any coding errors or something that doesn't follow a best practice / could be written more clearly, please let me know!

It should be noted that this is still very much in development at the moment, and shouldn't be used as a live website. For instance, authors don't have names yet. Hopefully soon we'll be able to offer a stable release however!

=== Future Plans
* Inline comment moderation
* Ajax Comments
* Admin backend
* XML-RPC Server
* Global Comment Credential Cookies
* Tests
* Inline JS Validations
* Akismet Protection
* Post Draft Support (autosaving?)
* Syntax Highlighting
* Email Options (New Comment)
* File Upload
* Thumbnail Support
* Image Galleries
* Image Watermark
* Admin Bar
* Microdata
* Google Author Support
* IE9 Pinned Site Support
* Blog Mentions

If you'd like to help out with any of these features, let me know!
